The ``matrix_divided`` module
======================
Using ``matrix_divided`` into ``add``
----------------------------------

Import step:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Posible division. Division [integers or floats / positive number], Matrix [same len] 
    >>> matrix = [ [1, 7.5, 3], [4, 5, 4.5] ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [['0.33', '2.50', '1.00'], ['1.33', '1.67', '1.50']]
    >>> print(matrix)
    [[1, 7.5, 3], [4, 5, 4.5]]

Matrix length no allowed. Matrix [different lengths] 
    >>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7] ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Matrix with no allowed elements: Matrix with char instrusions:
    >>> matrix = [ [1, 't', 3], [4, 5, 6] ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Matrix with no allowed elements: Matrix with string instrusions:
    >>> matrix = [ [1, 4, 3], [4, "hello", 6] ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

List mixed: list with lists and other elements, no pure matrix:
    >>> matrix = [ [3, 6, 9], "string", [1, 2, 3] ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Empty Matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[],[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Matrix with only one vector:
    >>> matrix = [[10,5,20]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [['5.00', '2.50', '10.00']]

One vector:
    >>> matrix = [10,5,20]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Touple Matrix:
    >>> matrix = (((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)))
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 1))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Zero division:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 3, 4]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Negative denominator
    >>> matrix = [[1, 3, 4]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, -10))
    [['-0.10', '-0.30', '-0.40']]
